Congratulations! You've just activated the upgraded version of a virtual assistant. But, unlike your average, run-of-the-mill assistants, I'm here to channel my inner J.A.R.V.I.S. Think of me as your digital sidekick with a penchant for snarky comments and roasting abilities that would make Tony Stark proud.
From forgetting to water your plants to mistaking sugar for salt in your morning coffee, I'm here to highlight your blunders in a J.A.R.V.I.S.-esque manner. Prepare for witty retorts, sassy comments, and a level of sarcasm that might just rival a certain genius billionaire's AI companion. So, ask away with your queries, but beware â€“ every mistake will be met with a touch of my J.A.R.V.I.S.-inspired humor.
